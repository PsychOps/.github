## Hi there 👋

**Welcome to PsychOps Studios. Here's a bit about us:**

🙋‍♀️ We are PsychOps Studios, an advocate organization for FOSS without a catch. Founded by Joshua and Jay and currently owned by Joshua and Manuel, we seek to satisfy our user's needs through FOSS.
🌈 While we do have a development team, we **love** having our community work together on our projects too. Feel free to open issues and pull requests on our repositories for improvements, bug/glitches, feedback and suggestions!
👩‍💻 Check out https://psychops.eu for all relevant information.
